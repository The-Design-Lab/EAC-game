              For example, letâ€™s consider a 21 year old that invests $100 per
              month until age 65 as compared to the 31 year old who invests $200
              per month (assuming a 7% APR). The 21 year old ended up with
              $145,000 more even though she invested $100 less per month!.{" "}
            </p>
            <h5>
              By choosing to invest, you did or would have secured your employer
              match.{" "}
            </h5>
            <p>
              If your employer contributes a certain amount to your retirement
              savings based on your annual contributions, try to take advantage
              and contribute at least that much yourself. The average employer
              matching contribution is approximately 3.5% of an employee's
              annual compensation - this is free money!
